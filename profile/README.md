# Operation: Global Liberation

**The Goal:** To inspire cooperation, humanitarianism, and egalitarianism on a global scale, and encourage all people to take responsibility for the role they play in the World, as a collective grassroots effort.

This is a tall, daunting task. Many will ask, "how?" -- and, right now, the answer is simple: *We don't know, but if we don't try, we have already failed.* Many will seek to discredit the ideas and propositions, saying they are not intenible and will not bear fruit, to which we say, "Have you got a better idea that doesn't place blind faith in an against-all-odds gamble?"

This is not a fairy tale. Things don't just "work out" in the real world. Real change happens not because someone wished upon a star and let somebody else handle it, but because normal people made a decision to be the change necessary in the world. Now, collectively, we must all become the necessary change to solve the world's many problems -- **we have no other choice**.
